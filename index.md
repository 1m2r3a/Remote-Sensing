## Remote Sensing: A programming guide for newbie's
### Overview
Since the field of remote sensing is so wide spread but is lacking infomration on the programming side, I though a short blog where you can find useful information without much digging around will come in hand.

### Introduction
Remote sensing is getting information about an object without physically touching an object. Since it is a field of study we can find remote sensing in different uses from medical i.e. MRI to geography i.e. urban planning.

The main focus of remote sensing is geography which studies the satellite images or airplane. There are various satellites wich can capture different wave lengths using different sensors at different resolution. In general there are two types of images captured by satellites high resolution https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/ and medium resolution https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/other-satellite-sensors/ , each type having different application.

###Landsat 
Landsat is one of the first satellite with the remote sensing scope to orbit to earth.

### Getting the input
One of the best website for getting the satellite images is from United States Geological Survey and can be found at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ which offers a interface similar to Google Earth
